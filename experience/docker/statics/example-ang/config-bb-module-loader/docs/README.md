# config-bb-module-loader


Version: **1.2.7**

Configuration module for the SystemJS module loader

This configuration module is intended to be replaced and overwritten per project. It is used
to customize the SystemJS Module loader, which can be used to both lazy-load modules demand and
to locate modules within optimized bundles.

The full power of SystemJS is available and the documentation on its configuration can be found
on the project's page, specifically
https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs/blob/0.19.38/docs/config-api.md

The default implementation in this module lazy-loads all modules based on the naming convention
that is compatible with other tooling (`bb-package`) and the default CXP file structure.

E.g.
Loading `lib-bb-i18n-ng`
-> `<RESOURCE_ROOT>/static/features/[BBHOST]/lib-bb-i18n-ng/scripts/lib-bb-i18n-ng.js`

Loading `widget-bb-sample-ng`
-> `<RESOURCE_ROOT>/static/widgets/[BBHOST]/widget-bb-example-ng/scripts/widget-bb-sample-ng.js`

Loading `config-bb-locale/assets/custom-locale.json`
-> `<RESOURCE_ROOT>/static/features/[BBHOST]/config-bb-locale/assets/custom-locale.json`

Where `RESOURCE_ROOT` is configured on the portal server

The default implementation is generated by the [@bb-cli/bb-bundle](http://npmjs.com/package/@bb-cli/bb-bundle)
tool. It's recommended that you also use this tool to generate your own config as it will
allow you to create concatted and minified JS bundles.
